# TimePlanner

TimePlanner finds the available times for meet-ups in a group



Input how many people will there be. Should be 2n (2, 4, 6 ..)

Write the first person's available times, then the second person's...

The program compares two consecutive people, and finds the available time for them. Then it goes to the next two people.

For now, your output will be the available times found for each two people.

Finding the ultimate available time for the group is not yet implemented, but planned.
